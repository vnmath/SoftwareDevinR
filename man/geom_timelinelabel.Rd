\title{Module 2: Visualization Tools: Visualize the times at which earthquakes occur within certain countries
This geom adds a vertical line to each data point with a text annotation
(e.g. the location of the earthquake) attached to each line. There should be an option
to subset to n_max number of earthquakes, where we take the n_max largest (by magnitude) earthquakes.
Aesthetics are x, which is the date of the earthquake
and label which takes the column name from which annotations will be obtained.}

\arguments{
\item{mapping}{The mappings created.}

\item{data}{The data need to display in this layer.}

\item{stat}{The statistical transformation to use on the data for this layer.}

\item{position}{Position adjustment}

\item{na.rm}{Missing values are removed with if false}

\item{show.legend}{logical. This layer be included in the legends or not}

\item{inherit.aes}{Override the default aesthetic if false}

\item{...}{Other arguments passed on to [layer()].

\code{geom_timeline_label} understands the following aesthetics
\itemize{
  \item \strong{\code{x}}     # Time variable
  \item \strong{\code{label}} # Annotations to the earthquake data
  \item \code{y}              # Stratification
  \item \code{n_max}          # number of earthquakes of subset corresponding to their magnitude (EQ_PRIMARY)
  \item \code{y_length}       # vertical line length to each data point
}}
}
\value{
The geom \code{geom_timeline_label} used with the \code{ggplot} function
and the \code{geom_timeline} geom, add annotations to the n_max largest (by magnitude) earthquakes.

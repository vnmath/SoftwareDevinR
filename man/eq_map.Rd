}
\arguments{
\item{mapdata}{A data frame with data obtained from NOAA website}

\item{annot_col}{The name of the column from the data to be use for annotation}

\value{
A map of the earthquakes epicenters and giving some annotations
}
\description{
maps the epicenters (LATITUDE/LONGITUDE) and annotates each point with in
pop up window containing annotation data stored in a column of the data frame
}
\details{
After downloading, reading and cleaning the dataset from NOAA site,
\url{https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/nndc/struts/form?t=101650&s=1&d=1}.
National Geophysical Data Center / World Data Service (NGDC/WDS): Significant Earthquake Database.
National Geophysical Data Center, NOAA.
The cleaning of the data frame is done with the eq_clean_data() function of this package.
The function return a map of the earthquakes epicenters (LATITUDE/LONGITUDE) and annotates each point with
in pop up window containing annotation data stored in a column of the cleaned data frame.
The user is able to choose which column is used for the annotation in the pop-up with this function
by using the argument named "annot_col". If the "annot_col" argument is not used, then the value of the "DATE" column is used.
On the map, each earthquake is shown with a circle, and the radius of the circle
is proportional to the earthquake's magnitude (EQ_PRIMARY).
